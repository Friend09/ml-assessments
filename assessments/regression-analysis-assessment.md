# Regression Analysis Assessment

## Objective
Predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset `house_prices.csv` contains information about houses including features like size, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with their prices.

## Tasks

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Load the `house_prices.csv` file using pandas
   - Handle any missing values in the dataset
   - Encode categorical variables if present

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Display summary statistics of the numerical features
   - Create a correlation heatmap of the features
   - Plot a scatter plot of house size vs. price

3. Feature Selection
   - Identify the top 5 features that have the strongest correlation with the house price
   - Explain why you chose these features

4. Model Selection and Training
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)
   - Choose an appropriate regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting Regressor)
   - Train the model on the training data
   - Explain your choice of algorithm

5. Making Predictions
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set
   - Calculate and display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score of your model
   - Plot the predicted prices against the actual prices

## Submission
Submit your completed Jupyter notebook with all the code and explanations for each step.
