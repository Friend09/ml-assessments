# Clustering Assessment

## Objective
Identify customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset `customer_data.csv` contains information about customers including their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Tasks

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Load the `customer_data.csv` file using pandas
   - Check for and handle any missing values or outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Display summary statistics of the features
   - Create a scatter plot of annual income vs. spending score
   - Plot histograms for each feature

3. Feature Scaling
   - Normalize the features using StandardScaler
   - Explain why feature scaling is important for clustering algorithms

4. Clustering
   - Use the K-means algorithm to cluster the customers
   - Implement the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters
   - Explain your choice of the number of clusters

5. Visualization and Interpretation
   - Create a scatter plot of the clustered data (use different colors for each cluster)
   - Calculate and display the cluster centroids
   - Provide a brief interpretation of each cluster's characteristics

## Submission
Submit your completed Jupyter notebook with all the code and explanations for each step.
